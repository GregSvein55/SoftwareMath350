# SoftwareMath350
This is a collection of all my labs that i completed in my mathematics for software engineers course. These are completed in python, using the Jupyter notebook .ipynb files. These labs gave me a hands on look at the topics taught in class such as RSA and solving non-linear equations.<br/>
## Lab 1
The goal of this lab was to give us some practice in Python and Jupyter Notebook, we implemented and tested a greatest common divider function and a pulverizer function 
<br/>
## Lab 2
This lab was look into RSA Keys, we made functions to make both the public and private keys, then tested the system by encrypting and dencrypting messages. We also looked at how this would be used in practice with very large prime numbers
<br/>
## Lab 3
This lab looked at matrices, and soving using LU Decomposition
<br/>
## Lab 4
This lab looked at finding the derivatives of non-linear functons using the Newton-Raphson, Secant, and Bisection methods.
